export const doc = `This document provides an overview of the fundamental concepts that drive React's design and architecture. It covers the core principles that make React a powerful library for building user interfaces, including the component model, virtual DOM, declarative programming paradigm, and reconciliation process.

1. What is React?
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. At its core, React provides a component-based architecture and an efficient rendering system. The library's design principles focus on three main aspects:

Declarative UI: React makes it painless to create interactive user interfaces by using a declarative paradigm. You describe how your UI should look at any given state, and React efficiently updates and renders the right components when data changes.

Component-Based Architecture: React encourages building encapsulated, reusable components that manage their own state. Components can be composed to build complex user interfaces.

Learn Once, Write Anywhere: React's design allows it to render on different platforms, including browsers (via ReactDOM), mobile devices (via React Native), and servers (via server-side rendering).`
